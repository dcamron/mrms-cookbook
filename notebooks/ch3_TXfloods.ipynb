    "The Multi-Radar/Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system is a set of real-time analysis products developed by NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). It brings together data from:\n",
    "- Dozens of NEXRAD radars\n",
    "- Surface observations\n",
    "- Satellites\n",
    "- Lightning detection networks\n",
    "\n",
    "to create high-resolution snapshots of precipitation, severe weather, and related hazards.\n",

    "MRMS updates every 2.5 minutes and is commonly used in operational forecasting, hydrology, aviation, and research.\n",

    "- Access MRMS Layer Composite Reflectivity Low data from AWS Open Data\n",
    "- Plot a single reflectivity frame as a static map\n",
    "- Animate a 6-frame sequence from July 4, 2025, during the Central Texas flood event\n",
