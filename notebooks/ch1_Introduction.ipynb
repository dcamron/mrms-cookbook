    "### What is MRMS?\n",
    "The Multi-Radar/ Multi-Sensor (MRMS) System is a radar system developed by the National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) that integrates data from satellites, radars, numerical prediction models, rain gauges, observations, and lightning reports into a standardized grid. Its goal is to provide smooth, high-resolution, and consistent weather products to inform decision-support services, aviation, transportation, numerical weather forecasting, hydrology, and public messaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features include:\n",
    "* 3D radar mosaics\n",
    "* 1-km x 2-minute update cycle\n",
    "* Severe weather and aviation products\n",
    "* Covers CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, (parts of) the Caribbean, Guam, and parts of southern Canada"

    "\n",
    "* Radars: Weather Surveillance Radar (WSR-88D), Canadian radar networks, Terminal Doppler Weather Radars (TDWRs), commercial radars, and more. \n",
    "* Satellite: Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). Provides continuous data on atmospheric conditions.\n",
    "* Numerical prediction models: High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), Rapid Refresh (RAP).\n",
    "* Surface observations\n",
    "* Rain gauges: approximately 7,000 hourly rain gauge sensors, Hydrometeorological Automated Data System (HADS)\n",
